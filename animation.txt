🎯 Interview Explanation: How Flip Animation Works
✅ 1. Overall Principle
The card has two sides:

A front face (the image shown when flipped)

A back face (what you see initially)

We simulate a 3D flip effect using CSS transform: rotateY(180deg) and backface-visibility.

✅ 2. HTML Structure (Core to the Flip)
Each .memory-card contains two images:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="memory-card">
  <img class="front-face" src="..." />
  <img class="back-face" src="..." />
</div>
Both faces are absolutely positioned on top of each other.

The card container (.memory-card) acts as the "3D cube" that we rotate.

✅ 3. CSS Key Concepts
🧩 .memory-card acts as the flippable container:
css
Copy
Edit
.memory-card {
  transform-style: preserve-3d; /* Allow children to be transformed in 3D */
  transition: transform 0.5s;   /* Smooth flip animation */
}
🎴 Front and back faces:
css
Copy
Edit
.front-face,
.back-face {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  backface-visibility: hidden; /* Hides the back when not facing viewer */
}
🧲 Flip logic:
css
Copy
Edit
.memory-card.flip {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);  /* This is what flips the card */
}
🔁 Front face is already rotated:
css
Copy
Edit
.front-face {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);  /* Pre-rotated so when card flips, it faces you */
}
🧠 Interview Summary Points (To Say Verbally):
The flipping animation is achieved through 3D transforms using rotateY(180deg) on the card container. Each card has two absolutely positioned child elements (front and back). The front face is pre-rotated 180 degrees, and backface-visibility: hidden ensures only the correct face is visible at a time. When the card is flipped, we rotate the whole container, bringing the front face into view.

✅ Bonus: Key Terms to Drop in Interviews
Concept	Explanation
transform-style	Enables child elements to render in 3D
rotateY()	Rotates around Y-axis (flip effect)
backface-visibility	Hides the reverse side of an element
transition	Adds smooth animation
preserve-3d	Prevents flattening of children

🔎 Interview Tip:
If asked "Can you make this flip vertically instead of horizontally?"

➡️ Just change:

css
Copy
Edit
transform: rotateY(180deg);
to:

css
Copy
Edit
transform: rotateX(180deg);

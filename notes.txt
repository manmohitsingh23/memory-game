âœ… 1. Explain the Logic in Simple Points
ðŸ§  How the Game Works (Step-by-Step):
User clicks a card â†’ flipCard() is triggered.

If it's the first card, it's stored in firstCard, and hasFlippedCard is set to true.

On second click, it stores the card as secondCard, and checks:

If firstCard.dataset.framework === secondCard.dataset.framework

If they match:

Both cards stay flipped (event listeners removed).

If they donâ€™t match:

Cards flip back after 1.5 seconds (setTimeout).

resetBoard() resets all temporary states.

A shuffle() function randomly assigns CSS order to mix up cards each load.
